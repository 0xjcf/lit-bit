# Re-Entry Prompt (copy-paste into AI chat)
<re-entry_prompt>
I’m resuming work on the Rust-Statechart project (lit-bit repo).

1. Please read the latest entry in prompts/project/PROGRESS.md and summarise:
   • Date, author, phase, work done, and “Next” item.

2. Open the active phase checklist (look at the phase named in the summary, e.g. prompts/phases/02-development/00_checklist.md) and:
   • List the boxes that are still unchecked.
   • Highlight any line annotated with “⚠ blocked”.

3. Based on the above, propose the top two concrete tasks I should tackle in this session (include file paths and suggested commits).
