## 2025-05-15 · _Session Start_
*   _Author_: @Gemini (via @0xjcf)
*   _Phase_: 02-hierarchy-guards (Semantic Analysis Stage)
*   _Work_: Discussed and agreed on design for `TmpState` struct and semantic analysis phase. Confirmed error strategy (syn::Error for parsing, compile_error! for semantics), deferred full event enum validation, and backlogged `.foo` shorthand.
*   _Next_: Define `TmpState` struct and skeleton for the recursive builder function that traverses `StateChartInputAst` to populate the `TmpState` tree (Task 3.1 & 3.2 from Huddle).

## 2025-05-15 · _Session End (Parser Complete)_
*   _Author_: @Gemini (via @0xjcf)
*   _Phase_: 02-hierarchy-guards (Parser Stage)
*   _Work_: Completed and stabilized the procedural macro parser (`lit-bit-macro`):
    *   All 31 parser unit tests for DSL AST nodes (header, states, entry/exit, initial, transitions, guards, actions) are passing.
    *   Refined AST naming conventions and keyword token handling.
    *   Addressed all clippy lints in the macro crate.
    *   Corrected Cargo workspace setup, profile warnings, and `justfile` for workspace operations.
    *   (Commit: `[PLACEHOLDER_FOR_PARSER_COMPLETE_COMMIT]`)
*   _Next_: Design `TmpState` structure for semantic analysis and tree building.

## 2025-05-14 · _Session Start_
*   _Author_: @Gemini (via @0xjcf)
*   _Phase_: 02-hierarchy-guards
*   _Work_: Started Phase 2. Created the Phase 2 checklist (`prompts/phases/02-hierarchy-guards/02_hierarchy_guards_checklist.md`) and the detailed task decomposition file (`prompts/decomposition/02_hierarchy_guards_tasks.md`).
*   _Next_: Begin implementation of Parent/Child state concepts: Design data structures for state hierarchy (Task 1.1 from `02_hierarchy_guards_tasks.md`).

## 2025-05-14 · _Session End (Phase 1 Complete)_
*   _Author_: @Gemini (via @0xjcf)
*   _Phase_: 01-core-runtime
*   _Work_: Completed Phase 1:
    *   Implemented core state machine runtime (`StateMachine`, `Runtime`, `Transition`).
    *   Added `traffic_light` example for RISC-V (`riscv32imac-unknown-none-elf`) with semihosting and UART output via QEMU.
    *   Added `traffic_light_cortex_m` example for `thumbv7m-none-eabi` with basic size check.
    *   Established dual-target `#![no_std]` build system (`Cargo.toml` target-specific deps/dev-deps, `build.rs` for memory maps, `.cargo/config.toml` for runners/linker flags).
    *   Refined `justfile` for new build/run/test tasks.
    *   Resolved compiler warnings (module attributes, test profile panic).
    *   Updated `commit_convention.mdc` rule with explicit line length limits.
    *   (Commit: `6808002e`)
*   _Next_: Begin Phase 2 (Hierarchy & Guards).

## 2025-05-12 · _Session End (Phase 0 Complete)_
*   _Author_: @Gemini (via @0xjcf)
*   _Phase_: 00-planning (Spec & Foundations)
*   _Work_: Completed Phase 0: Added CI skeleton (`check`, `fmt`, `clippy`), added license files (`MIT`, `APACHE`) and header to `src/lib.rs`, noted grammar freeze in rules, updated task list. Commit `19333811`.
*   _Next_: Begin Phase 1 (Core Runtime).

---

## 2025-05-12 · _Session Start_
*   _Author_: @Gemini (via @0xjcf)
*   _Phase_: 00-planning (Spec & Foundations)
*   _Work_: Restructured project to library layout (`lib.rs`), configured `Cargo.toml` (features, metadata), completed detailed v0.1 `Spec.md` incorporating review feedback. Commit `3749ea3c`.
*   _Next_: Implement CI skeleton (Phase 0 remaining task) or begin Phase 1 (Core Runtime).

---

## 2025-05-12 · _Session Start_
*   _Author_: @0xjcf
*   _Phase_: 00-planning (Spec & Foundations)
*   _Work_: Initial project setup via commit `96ab4df`. Includes Rust agent structure, ROADMAP, Spec draft, core prompts, dev rules, and pre-commit hook for progress logging.
*   _Next_: Flesh out `Spec.md` details (Grammar, Semantics) or set up Rust crate scaffold.
