# Progress Log - 2025-05-21

## Session Summary
* **Author**: @Gemini (via @0xjcf)
* **Phase**: 03-parallel-states (Macro Refactor & Test Corrections)
* **Branch**: feat/parallel-states

## Work Completed

### Major Macro Refactor
* **Refactored the `statechart!` macro's code generation** for the `send` method
  * Now delegates directly to `Runtime::send_internal` in `lit-bit-core`
  * **Resolved persistent E0317 linter error** ("if may be missing else clause")
  * **Fixed numerous test failures** related to incorrect transition processing in hierarchical and parallel states

### Code Cleanup
* **Removed obsolete functions** from `lit-bit-macro`:
  * `generate_send_method` function (no longer needed)
  * `analyse_event_pattern` function (no longer needed)
* **Addressed various Clippy lints** across `lit-bit-macro` and `lit-bit-core`:
  * `dead_code`
  * `trivially_copy_pass_by_ref`
  * `uninlined_format_args`
  * `unreachable_code`

### Test Corrections
* **Corrected test logic** in `core::tests::send_event_no_transition_if_guard_fails`
* **Standardized log messages** in `basic_machine_integration_test::parallel_initial_state_test`
* **Temporarily commented out `LoadTrack` event** and associated logic in `media_player.rs` example
  * Resolved compile errors from incomplete implementation
  * Enabled other tests to pass

### Pattern Matching Enhancement
* **Implemented match-based dispatch** for send method
* **Enhanced event pattern matching** capabilities

## Git Commits
* **Hash**: `c30ff0a` - "fix(macro): delegate send method to runtime, resolving E0317"
* **Hash**: `95e3112` - "I've made some fixes to address compiler errors in the statechart! procedural macro. Here's a summary:"
* **Hash**: `442ff6e` - "refactor(macro): implement match-based dispatch for send method"

## Next Steps
* Re-evaluate implementation of events with data (like `LoadTrack`) and guards
* Ensure new `Runtime::send_internal` delegation handles them correctly
* Address any remaining failing tests from this significant refactor
* Continue with Phase 03 tasks, focusing on robust parallel state functionality
