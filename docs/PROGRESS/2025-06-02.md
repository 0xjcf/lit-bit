# Progress Log - 2025-06-02

## Session Summary
* **Author**: AI-agent (Claude Sonnet 4)
* **Phase**: 05-async-side-effects
* **Sprint**: Sprint 4 - Task 5.3 (Async Test Kit)
* **Branch**: main

## Work Completed

### Major Category: Test Infrastructure Implementation

* **Implemented Task 1**: Cross-runtime TestKit infrastructure for deterministic async actor testing
* **Created comprehensive test utilities module** with conditional compilation for zero-cost production builds
* **Built async state probes** for observing actor lifecycle events and state transitions
* **Developed instrumented actor wrapper** that adds probe instrumentation without changing behavior
* **Added cross-runtime support** for both Tokio and Embassy runtimes
* **Implemented proper string handling** for no_std environments using heapless collections

### Technical Accomplishments

1. **Test Utils Module Structure**:
   - Created `lit-bit-core/src/test_utils/mod.rs` with conditional compilation
   - Added re-exports for convenient usage with `#[cfg(any(test, feature = "test-probes"))]`
   - Ensured zero cost in production builds

2. **Probe Infrastructure**:
   - Implemented `ProbeEvent` enum with `StateTransition`, `MessageReceived`, `ActorStarted`, `ActorStopped`, and `PanicOccurred` variants
   - Built `ActorProbe<A>` struct with async methods for deterministic event waiting
   - Added timeout mechanisms using platform-appropriate APIs (tokio::time vs embassy_time)
   - Created helper functions for safe string creation in no_std environments

3. **Instrumented Actor Wrapper**:
   - Developed `InstrumentedActor<A>` that implements the Actor trait
   - Forwards all calls to inner actor while emitting probe events
   - Uses different probe channels based on runtime (Tokio mpsc vs Embassy heapless)
   - Maintains zero-cost abstraction principles

4. **TestKit Implementation**:
   - Created unified API for testing actors across different async runtimes
   - Implemented `spawn_actor_with_probe()` method for Tokio runtime
   - Added time control methods (`pause_time`, `resume_time`, `advance_time`)
   - Included `wait_for_quiescence()` for deterministic test conditions
   - Provided placeholder for Embassy implementation (limited by Embassy's concrete task requirements)

5. **String Type Management**:
   - Conditional string types: `alloc::string::String` for std/alloc, `heapless::String<64>` for no_std
   - Helper functions `create_probe_string()` for safe string creation
   - Proper handling of type name extraction for message type logging

6. **Feature Flag Integration**:
   - Added `test-probes = ["async"]` feature to Cargo.toml
   - Conditional compilation throughout to ensure test utilities only available when needed
   - Integration with existing async-tokio and async-embassy features

## Git Commits
No commits made during this session - all changes were implemented but not yet committed.

## Testing Status
* **All tests passing**: 130 total tests across workspace (30 + 73 + 27)
  - Core library: 30 tests including 10 new test_utils tests
  - Macro crate: 73 tests  
  - Integration suite: 27 tests
* **All clippy checks pass** with `-D warnings` flag
* **Zero warnings**: All compilation warnings resolved including dead code warnings
* **Compilation errors resolved**: Fixed format! macro issue for no_std compatibility
* **Test suite specific tests**:
  - `probe_event_equality_works`
  - `state_transition_event_equality` 
  - `test_error_display` (fixed for no_std)
  - `instrumented_actor_forwards_calls`
  - `instrumented_actor_provides_inner_access`
  - `instrumented_actor_implements_send_when_inner_is_send`
  - `test_kit_creation`
  - `test_kit_time_control`
  - `spawn_actor_with_probe_works`
  - `simple_time_advancement`
* **Multiple feature combinations tested**: `test-probes`, `async-tokio,test-probes`
* **Clean build**: No compilation errors or warnings

## Implementation Quality
* **Zero-cost abstractions**: Test utilities only compile when explicitly enabled
* **Cross-runtime compatibility**: Works with both Tokio and Embassy (with noted limitations)
* **Type safety**: Strong typing throughout with proper GAT usage
* **Memory safety**: No unsafe code, relies on automatic Send derivation
* **Error handling**: Comprehensive TestError enum with timeout and unexpected end cases
* **Documentation**: Extensive rustdoc comments with examples

## Next Steps
1. **Commit the implemented changes** to preserve the TestKit infrastructure work
2. **Continue with Task 2 (Panic Recovery)**: Implement JoinHandle monitoring and supervision integration
3. **Add property-based testing integration** using proptest for more comprehensive testing
4. **Enhance Embassy support** by creating concrete task functions for specific actor types
5. **Consider adding tokio-test integration** for more sophisticated time control in tests
6. **Validate integration** with existing supervision system from previous phases

## Notes
* Embassy implementation is currently limited due to Embassy's requirement for concrete (non-generic) tasks
* Tokio time control functions are simplified pending proper tokio-test integration
* The implementation follows the research findings closely and provides the foundation for deterministic async actor testing
* All code follows the project's explicit naming conventions and respects the linter requirements

## Files Modified
* `lit-bit-core/src/test_utils/mod.rs` (new)
* `lit-bit-core/src/test_utils/probes.rs` (new)
* `lit-bit-core/src/test_utils/instrumented_actor.rs` (new)
* `lit-bit-core/src/test_utils/test_kit.rs` (new)
* `lit-bit-core/src/lib.rs` (added test_utils module)
* `lit-bit-core/Cargo.toml` (added test-probes feature)

This work represents a significant milestone in Phase 5, providing the foundation for deterministic testing of async actor systems across different runtimes while maintaining the project's zero-cost abstraction principles.
