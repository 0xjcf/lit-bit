## Task 5.4 Phase 2 Priority 1 Implementation - Enhanced Supervision Integration

### Major Category: OTP-Style Supervision Framework (COMPLETE)

* **Enhanced RestartStrategy enum**: Added comprehensive OTP-inspired restart policies
  - **Permanent**: Always restart on any termination (normal or abnormal)
  - **Transient**: Restart only on abnormal termination (panic/error), not on normal exit  
  - **Temporary**: Never restart, let the actor die permanently
  - **Escalate**: Don't restart, escalate failure to parent supervisor
  - **Never**: Explicit no-restart policy (clearer than Temporary)
  - Comprehensive documentation explaining use cases for each policy
  - Compatible with existing OneForOne, OneForAll, RestForOne patterns

* **Implemented RestartIntensity configuration**: Deterministic backoff and rate limiting
  - `max_restarts`: Maximum number of restarts within time window before escalating
  - `restart_window_ms`: Time window for restart counting (milliseconds)
  - `backoff_strategy`: Configurable backoff behavior with deterministic delays
  - Default configuration: 5 restarts in 60 seconds with exponential backoff (100ms base, 30s max)

* **Created BackoffStrategy enum**: Multiple deterministic backoff algorithms
  - `Immediate`: No delay between restart attempts
  - `Linear`: delay = base_delay_ms * failure_count  
  - `Exponential`: delay = base_delay_ms * 2^failure_count (capped at max)
  - `Fixed`: Fixed delay regardless of failure count
  - All strategies ensure predictable behavior for embedded and real-time systems

* **Developed PanicAnalyzer trait**: Extensible panic analysis framework
  - `should_restart()`: Analyze panic and determine if actor should be restarted
  - `calculate_backoff_delay()`: Calculate deterministic backoff delay for restart
  - `should_escalate()`: Determine if supervisor should escalate failure
  - Designed for custom supervision policies based on panic details and actor context

* **Implemented DefaultPanicAnalyzer**: Sensible OTP-style defaults
  - Restarts on panics, custom errors, startup failures, mailbox closed, timeout
  - Does not restart on supervision failures or clean shutdown failures
  - Deterministic backoff calculations with overflow protection
  - Escalates when restart intensity exceeded (failure_count >= max_restarts)

### Major Category: Hierarchical Supervision Support (COMPLETE)

* **Created EscalationPolicy enum**: Multi-level supervision tree support
  - `TerminateSelf`: Supervisor terminates itself on escalation (simple meltdown)
  - `NotifyParent`: Send escalation message to parent supervisor (controlled escalation)
  - `Custom`: Apply custom escalation logic via trait method
  - Enables controlled fault propagation in supervision hierarchies

* **Enhanced SupervisorMessage enum**: Added hierarchical supervision messaging
  - `ChildEscalated`: New message type for escalated failures
  - Contains supervisor_id, failed_child_id, and original error information
  - Enables multi-level supervision trees with controlled fault propagation
  - Updated supervision.rs Actor implementation to handle escalation messages

* **Updated SupervisorActor**: Enhanced escalation handling
  - Added `ChildEscalated` message processing in handle() method
  - Treats escalation as supervisor failure requiring restart evaluation
  - Comprehensive logging for escalation scenarios
  - Maintains existing supervision semantics while adding hierarchical capabilities

### Major Category: Enhanced Actor Lifecycle Hooks (COMPLETE)

* **Added on_restart() hook to Actor trait**: State reset capability for supervision
  - Called before restart to reset state when restarted by supervisor
  - Called after actor creation but before first message processing
  - Returns `Result<(), ActorError>` for restart preparation validation
  - Includes `#[allow(clippy::result_large_err)]` for linter compliance

* **Extended AsyncActor trait**: Consistent lifecycle hooks across actor types
  - Added `on_restart()` method with same semantics as Actor trait
  - Maintains ergonomic async fn syntax when heap allocation available
  - Automatic implementation via blanket impl forwards to AsyncActor::on_restart

* **Enhanced BatchActor trait**: Complete lifecycle support for batch processing
  - Added `on_restart()` method for batch actor state reset
  - Consistent API across all actor trait variants
  - Enables supervision integration for high-throughput actors

### Major Category: Platform-Dual Supervision Enhancement (COMPLETE)

* **Updated get_children_to_restart() methods**: Support for new restart policies
  - Enhanced both std/alloc and no_std versions
  - OTP-style policies converted to appropriate classic patterns
  - Permanent/Transient map to OneForOne (restart just the failed child)
  - Temporary/Never/Escalate return empty list (no restart)
  - Maintains existing OneForOne/OneForAll/RestForOne semantics

* **Enhanced supervision message handling**: Complete support for new message types
  - Added `ChildEscalated` pattern matching in SupervisorActor::handle()
  - Treats escalated supervisors as failed children requiring restart evaluation
  - Maintains logging and debugging capabilities
  - Fixed unused variable warnings for full linter compliance

### Technical Accomplishments

1. **Research-Backed Implementation**: Based on comprehensive analysis of OTP, Actix, Ractor, and Bastion supervision patterns
2. **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: All new supervision features only active during failures, no steady-state overhead
3. **Platform Compatibility**: Works identically on Tokio (JoinHandle-based) and Embassy (message-based) runtimes
4. **Deterministic Behavior**: All backoff strategies provide predictable delays for embedded systems
5. **Full Linter Compliance**: Zero warnings across entire workspace after implementation
6. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing supervision code continues to work unchanged
7. **Extensible Design**: PanicAnalyzer trait allows custom supervision policies without framework changes
