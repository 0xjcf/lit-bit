# Progress Log - 2025-06-02

## Session Summary
* **Author**: @joseflores (with AI assistant - Claude Sonnet 4)
* **Phase**: 05-async-side-effects
* **Sprint**: Sprint 4 - Task 5.3 (Async Test Kit) + CI/CD Pipeline Maintenance
* **Branch**: main

## Work Completed

### Major Category: CI/CD Pipeline Fixes

* **Resolved Check & Lint (beta) job failures**: Fixed all clippy::uninlined_format_args warnings that were only caught by beta toolchain
* **Enhanced local linting capabilities**: Added `just lint-beta` and `just lint-ci` commands to match CI matrix locally
* **Fixed format string issues**: Updated two format strings in `lit-bit-core/src/test_utils/probes.rs` to use inline format arguments
* **Resolved nightly clippy warnings**: Added `#[allow(clippy::collapsible_if)]` directives for complex pattern matching cases
* **Improved development workflow**: Local linting now catches beta/nightly issues before CI, preventing build failures

### Major Category: Test Infrastructure Implementation

* **Implemented Task 1**: Cross-runtime TestKit infrastructure for deterministic async actor testing
* **Created comprehensive test utilities module** with conditional compilation for zero-cost production builds
* **Built async state probes** for observing actor lifecycle events and state transitions
* **Developed instrumented actor wrapper** that adds probe instrumentation without changing behavior
* **Added cross-runtime support** for both Tokio and Embassy runtimes
* **Implemented proper string handling** for no_std environments using heapless collections

### Major Category: Code Review and Quality Improvements

* **Addressed all TestKit code review items**: Fixed 4 identified issues in test_kit.rs for better maintainability and user experience
* **Resolved Duration import inconsistency**: Updated documentation examples to use `core::time::Duration` consistently with actual implementation
* **Eliminated magic numbers**: Extracted `DEFAULT_TEST_MAILBOX_CAPACITY` constant with clear documentation explaining its purpose for test environments
* **Fixed Embassy spawn runtime panics**: Replaced `unimplemented!()` with proper `Result<_, EmbassySpawnError>` return type and comprehensive error handling
* **Made quiescence delays configurable**: Added `wait_for_quiescence_with_timeout()` method to address hardcoded 10ms delays that could cause flaky tests
* **Implemented SafeProducer pattern for Embassy**: Solved interior mutability challenge using `critical_section::Mutex<RefCell<Producer>>` wrapper following production-grade embedded Rust patterns
* **Fixed compilation warnings**: Added feature gates to constants to prevent "unused" warnings when features are disabled

### Technical Accomplishments

1. **Test Utils Module Structure**:
   - Created `lit-bit-core/src/test_utils/mod.rs` with conditional compilation
   - Added re-exports for convenient usage with `#[cfg(any(test, feature = "test-probes"))]`
   - Ensured zero cost in production builds

2. **Probe Infrastructure**:
   - Implemented `ProbeEvent` enum with `StateTransition`, `MessageReceived`, `ActorStarted`, `ActorStopped`, and `PanicOccurred` variants
   - Built `ActorProbe<A>` struct with async methods for deterministic event waiting
   - Added timeout mechanisms using platform-appropriate APIs (tokio::time vs embassy_time)
   - Created helper functions for safe string creation in no_std environments

3. **Instrumented Actor Wrapper**:
   - Developed `InstrumentedActor<A>` that implements the Actor trait
   - Forwards all calls to inner actor while emitting probe events
   - Uses different probe channels based on runtime (Tokio mpsc vs Embassy heapless)
   - Maintains zero-cost abstraction principles
   - Implemented SafeProducer pattern for Embassy interior mutability using critical_section::Mutex<RefCell<Producer>>
   - Enables safe event emission from `&self` contexts (like panic handlers) in Embassy environments
   - Follows production-grade embedded Rust patterns from community research

4. **TestKit Implementation**:
   - Created unified API for testing actors across different async runtimes
   - Implemented `spawn_actor_with_probe()` method for Tokio runtime
   - Added time control methods (`pause_time`, `resume_time`, `advance_time`)
   - Included configurable `wait_for_quiescence()` and `wait_for_quiescence_with_timeout()` for deterministic test conditions
   - Proper error handling for Embassy spawn operations (returns Result instead of panicking)
   - Eliminated magic numbers with documented constants
   - Fixed documentation consistency issues

5. **String Type Management**:
   - Conditional string types: `alloc::string::String` for std/alloc, `heapless::String<64>` for no_std
   - Helper functions `create_probe_string()` for safe string creation
   - Proper handling of type name extraction for message type logging

6. **Feature Flag Integration**:
   - Added `test-probes = ["async"]` feature to Cargo.toml
   - Conditional compilation throughout to ensure test utilities only available when needed
   - Integration with existing async-tokio and async-embassy features
   - Added critical-section dependency for Embassy interior mutability support

7. **Code Quality and Maintainability**:
   - Addressed all identified code review issues for better user experience
   - Eliminated hardcoded values and improved configurability
   - Enhanced error handling with proper error types and messages
   - Fixed compilation warnings through appropriate feature gating
   - Improved documentation consistency between examples and implementation

* **Multiple feature combinations tested**: `test-probes`, `async-tokio,test-probes`, `async-embassy` (types only)
* **Clean build**: No compilation errors or warnings across all feature combinations

## Implementation Quality
* **Zero-cost abstractions**: Test utilities only compile when explicitly enabled
* **Cross-runtime compatibility**: Works with both Tokio and Embassy (with noted limitations addressed through proper error handling)
* **Type safety**: Strong typing throughout with proper GAT usage and error types
* **Memory safety**: No unsafe code, relies on automatic Send derivation and safe interior mutability patterns
* **Error handling**: Comprehensive TestError and EmbassySpawnError enums with timeout, unexpected end, and spawn limitation cases
* **Documentation**: Extensive rustdoc comments with examples and consistent Duration usage
* **Code review compliance**: All identified issues resolved with proper patterns and configurability
* **Production-grade patterns**: SafeProducer implements research-backed interior mutability solution for embedded environments

## Next Steps
1. **Commit the implemented changes** to preserve the TestKit infrastructure work
2. **Continue with Task 2 (Panic Recovery)**: Implement JoinHandle monitoring and supervision integration
3. **Add property-based testing integration** using proptest for more comprehensive testing
4. **Enhance Embassy support** by creating concrete task functions for specific actor types
5. **Consider adding tokio-test integration** for more sophisticated time control in tests
6. **Validate integration** with existing supervision system from previous phases

## Notes
* Embassy implementation is currently limited due to Embassy's requirement for concrete (non-generic) tasks
* Tokio time control functions are simplified pending proper tokio-test integration
* The implementation follows the research findings closely and provides the foundation for deterministic async actor testing
* All code follows the project's explicit naming conventions and respects the linter requirements

## Files Modified
* `lit-bit-core/src/test_utils/mod.rs` (new)
* `lit-bit-core/src/test_utils/probes.rs` (new, updated for CI compatibility)
* `lit-bit-core/src/test_utils/instrumented_actor.rs` (new, enhanced with SafeProducer pattern)

This work represents a significant milestone in Phase 5, providing the foundation for deterministic testing of async actor systems across different runtimes while maintaining the project's zero-cost abstraction principles. Additionally, the CI/CD pipeline improvements ensure robust multi-toolchain compatibility and provide developers with local tooling that matches the CI environment exactly, preventing future build failures and enhancing the development experience.
