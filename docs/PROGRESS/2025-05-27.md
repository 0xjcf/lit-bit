# Progress Log - 2025-05-27

## Session Summary
* **Author**: @0xjcf (with AI assistance)
* **Phase**: 04-minimal-actor-layer
* **Branch**: feat/phase-04-minimal-actor-layer

## Work Completed

### Major Code Review Resolution
* Addressed comprehensive code review feedback for Phase 4 actor layer implementation
* Resolved heap allocation issues in `create_mailbox` function
* Implemented safe static allocation patterns for no_std compliance
* Enhanced CLI robustness and safety across the codebase

### Actor Layer Safety Improvements
* **Safe Static Mailbox Pattern**: Replaced unsafe `create_mailbox` with safe `static_mailbox!` macro
  - Implemented atomic initialization guards to prevent double-splitting
  - Added memory placement attribute support for embedded control
  - Maintained std compatibility with existing Tokio patterns
* **Heap Allocation Elimination**: Removed `Box::leak` usage that violated no_std design principles
* **API Design**: Updated all examples to use safe static allocation patterns
* **Testing**: Added comprehensive testing for both std and no_std environments

### CLI Robustness Fixes
* **JSON Deserialization**: Fixed cargo-geiger JSON parsing with proper field mapping
  - Added `#[serde(rename)]` attributes for `impls`/`traits` keys
  - Implemented `#[serde(default)]` for graceful handling of missing fields
  - Added `Default` implementation for `UnsafeCount` to support version compatibility
* **Schema Alignment**: Fixed package struct schema to match cargo-geiger output format

### Safety and UB Prevention
* **DummyAlloc Fix**: Replaced null pointer returns with `panic!` to prevent undefined behavior
* **Memory Safety**: Ensured all allocator implementations follow Rust safety requirements
* **Static Analysis**: Verified no heap allocation in actor mailbox creation paths

### Additional Code Review Resolution (Session 2)
* **Static Mailbox Macro Symbol Conflicts**: Fixed `static_mailbox!` macro using fixed `INIT_FLAG` name
  - Added `paste = "1.0"` dependency for unique identifier generation
  - Updated macro to use `paste::paste!` with `[<$name _INIT_FLAG>]` pattern
  - Added comprehensive test verifying multiple macro invocations work without conflicts
* **Stable Rust Compatibility**: Resolved `impl Future` return type instability on stable Rust
  - Implemented conditional compilation for `Actor::on_event` return type
  - With `async` feature: Uses `futures::future::BoxFuture<'_, ()>` for stable compatibility
  - Without `async` feature: Uses `impl Future` for zero-cost no_std builds
  - Updated all Actor implementations across examples, tests, and library code
* **Architecture Support Expansion**: Fixed `DummyAlloc` limited to only `riscv32` and `arm` architectures
  - Changed from `#[cfg(any(target_arch = "riscv32", target_arch = "arm"))]` to `#[cfg(not(feature = "std"))]`
  - Now supports any no_std target (thumbv7em, xtensa, etc.) not just specific architectures
  - Maintained specific runtime entry points for riscv32 and arm while adding generic fallback

### Developer Experience Enhancements
* **Re-exports**: Added key actor types at crate root for improved usability
* **Examples**: Created `actor_simple_usage` example demonstrating safe patterns
* **Documentation**: Updated examples and documentation with best practices
* **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained compatibility for existing std usage patterns

### Research and Documentation
* **Research Completion**: Extensive research on safe static allocation patterns in Rust
* **Pattern Documentation**: Documented RTIC, Embassy, and other embedded framework patterns
* **Best Practices**: Identified and implemented idiomatic Rust patterns for no_std environments
* **Multi-Target Workspace Research**: Added comprehensive PDF documentation on structuring multi-target Rust workspaces
  - Covers dependency isolation strategies for no_std/std separation
  - Documents best practices from major embedded Rust projects
  - Provides concrete examples and migration patterns

## Git Commits
* **Hash**: `[staged]` - "fix(actor): resolve code review issues and improve safety patterns (Phase 4)"
  - Static mailbox macro symbol conflict resolution with paste crate
  - Stable Rust compatibility for Actor trait return types
  - Broader architecture support for DummyAlloc (any no_std target)
  - Enhanced actor integration with improved safety patterns
  - Added multi-target workspace research documentation
  - Updated examples to use safe static allocation patterns

## Testing Status
* ✅ All core library tests pass (both std and no_std)
* ✅ All integration tests pass
* ✅ Embedded target compilation verified (thumbv7m-none-eabi)
* ✅ All linting passes (clippy, rustfmt)
* ✅ Feature matrix testing complete
* ✅ No heap allocation verified in no_std builds

## Next Steps
* Complete commit with updated message reflecting all changes
* Continue Phase 4 implementation with remaining actor layer features
* Begin integration testing with statechart-actor blanket implementation
* Prepare for Phase 5 transition (async & side-effects)

## Technical Achievements
* **Zero-cost abstractions**: Maintained performance while improving safety
* **Platform-dual design**: Same code works on embedded and cloud environments
* **Type safety**: Compile-time guarantees for memory safety without runtime overhead
* **Ergonomics**: Simple macro interface hiding complexity from users
* **Standards compliance**: Follows Rust embedded best practices and project conventions
* **Stable Rust compatibility**: All code now compiles on stable Rust without nightly features
* **Broader architecture support**: Now works on any no_std target, not just specific architectures
* **Symbol safety**: Eliminated macro symbol conflicts through proper unique identifier generation

## Breaking Changes Introduced
* `create_mailbox` function signature changed to require static mutable reference
* Users should migrate to `static_mailbox!` macro for safe ergonomic alternative
* No impact on high-level actor usage patterns
