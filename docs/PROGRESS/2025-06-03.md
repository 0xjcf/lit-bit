# Progress Log - 2025-06-03

## Session Summary
* **Author**: @claude-4-sonnet MAX (via @0xjcf)
* **Phase**: 05-async-side-effects
* **Branch**: feat/phase-05-async-integration
* **Status**: UTF-8 Truncation Fix, Test Improvements, CI Pipeline Fix & Mailbox Patterns

## Work Completed

### CI Pipeline Improvements
* Fixed failing Check & Lint (stable) job by properly importing `Box` for alloc feature
* Updated `just lint-ci` command to exactly match CI checks including feature matrix testing
* Maintained separation between granular `just lint` and CI-matching `just lint-ci`
* Improved local development workflow by catching CI issues earlier

### UTF-8 Truncation Improvements
* Fixed failing test `utf8_truncation_does_not_split_characters` in panic handling
* Implemented more robust UTF-8 truncation logic that properly handles character sequences
* Added look-ahead mechanism to prevent splitting related characters (e.g., "Ã©â‚¬ðŸ˜€")
* Maintained no_std compatibility and panic-free guarantees
* Improved test coverage for edge cases with multi-byte characters

### Implementation Details
* Rewritten `push_str_truncate` to be more conservative about space allocation
* Added character sequence awareness to prevent partial UTF-8 sequence inclusion
* Maintained zero-cost abstraction principles with efficient byte-level operations
* Ensured all operations remain infallible for embedded targets
* Fixed Box import in spawn.rs to properly support alloc feature
* Fixed incorrect comment about `on_stop` method behavior in spawn.rs

### Test Improvements
* Fixed edge case where 120 bytes + "Ã©â‚¬ðŸ˜€" was incorrectly handled
* Added more detailed debug assertions for better error reporting
* Verified behavior with various UTF-8 sequences (2-byte, 3-byte, and 4-byte characters)
* All tests now passing (50 core tests, 73 macro tests, 27 integration tests)

### Mailbox Pattern Improvements
* Fixed heapless SPSC queue capacity handling (N-1 behavior)
* Added comprehensive mailbox patterns example (`mailbox_patterns.rs`)
* Created new `mailbox.rs` module with dedicated tests
* Improved documentation and examples for mailbox creation
* Added coffee shop example demonstrating real-world usage

### Actor Task Refactoring
* Refactored actor task implementations for better clarity
* Improved error handling in Tokio actor tasks
* Added better type constraints for Send + 'static
* Simplified batch actor task implementation
* Maintained no_std compatibility throughout changes

### Documentation & Examples
* Added detailed examples for both mailbox creation patterns
* Improved documentation for memory section placement
* Added comprehensive examples for static and dynamic mailboxes
* Added platform-specific behavior documentation
* Improved code comments and API documentation

### Mailbox Implementation Details
* Fixed `static_mailbox` macro to handle N-1 capacity correctly
* Unified `create_mailbox` function naming across features
* Added `define_static_mailbox` helper macro
* Improved error handling in actor task loops
* Added more test coverage for mailbox patterns

### Additional Test Improvements
* Added mailbox capacity limit tests
* Added zero-allocation verification tests
* Added multiple independent mailbox tests
* Improved test documentation and comments
* All tests now passing with better coverage

## Testing Status
* âœ… All core library tests passing (50/50)
* âœ… All macro tests passing (73/73)
* âœ… All integration tests passing (27/27)
* âœ… No regressions in other test suites
* âœ… UTF-8 validation tests specifically verified
* âœ… New mailbox pattern tests passing
* âœ… CI pipeline checks passing (stable/beta/nightly)

## Next Steps
* Consider extracting UTF-8 truncation utilities into a separate module for reuse
* Add more documentation about UTF-8 handling guarantees
* Consider adding property-based tests for UTF-8 truncation edge cases
* Review other string handling code for similar improvements
* Consider extracting more mailbox utilities into dedicated modules
* Add more examples for advanced mailbox patterns
* Consider adding property-based tests for mailbox behavior
* Review other actor components for similar improvements
