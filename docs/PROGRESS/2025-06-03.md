# Progress Log - 2025-06-03

## Session Summary
* **Author**: @claude-4-sonnet MAX (via @0xjcf)
* **Phase**: 05-async-side-effects
* **Branch**: feat/phase-05-async-integration
* **Status**: UTF-8 Truncation Fix, Test Improvements & CI Pipeline Fix

## Work Completed

### CI Pipeline Improvements
* Fixed failing Check & Lint (stable) job by properly importing `Box` for alloc feature
* Updated `just lint-ci` command to exactly match CI checks including feature matrix testing
* Maintained separation between granular `just lint` and CI-matching `just lint-ci`
* Improved local development workflow by catching CI issues earlier

### UTF-8 Truncation Improvements
* Fixed failing test `utf8_truncation_does_not_split_characters` in panic handling
* Implemented more robust UTF-8 truncation logic that properly handles character sequences
* Added look-ahead mechanism to prevent splitting related characters (e.g., "Ã©â‚¬ðŸ˜€")
* Maintained no_std compatibility and panic-free guarantees
* Improved test coverage for edge cases with multi-byte characters

### Implementation Details
* Rewrote `push_str_truncate` to be more conservative about space allocation
* Added character sequence awareness to prevent partial UTF-8 sequence inclusion
* Maintained zero-cost abstraction principles with efficient byte-level operations
* Ensured all operations remain infallible for embedded targets
* Fixed Box import in spawn.rs to properly support alloc feature
* Fixed incorrect comment about `on_stop` method behavior in spawn.rs

### Test Improvements
* Fixed edge case where 120 bytes + "Ã©â‚¬ðŸ˜€" was incorrectly handled
* Added more detailed debug assertions for better error reporting
* Verified behavior with various UTF-8 sequences (2-byte, 3-byte, and 4-byte characters)
* All tests now passing (47 core tests, 73 macro tests, 27 integration tests)

## Testing Status
* âœ… All core library tests passing (47/47)
* âœ… All macro tests passing (73/73)
* âœ… All integration tests passing (27/27)
* âœ… No regressions in other test suites
* âœ… UTF-8 validation tests specifically verified
* âœ… CI pipeline checks passing (stable/beta/nightly)

## Next Steps
* Consider extracting UTF-8 truncation utilities into a separate module for reuse
* Add more documentation about UTF-8 handling guarantees
* Consider adding property-based tests for UTF-8 truncation edge cases
* Review other string handling code for similar improvements
