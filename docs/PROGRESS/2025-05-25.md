### Afternoon Session: Phase 04 Actor Layer Implementation
* **MAJOR MILESTONE**: Completed ~85% of Phase 04 actor system implementation following research-informed task decomposition

#### Core Actor Framework (COMPLETE)
* **Actor Trait & Supervision**: Implemented minimal `Actor` trait with OTP-inspired supervision hooks
  * `async fn on_event()` with Send bounds for thread safety
  * Lifecycle hooks: `on_start()`, `on_stop()`, `on_panic()`

  * Zero-cost integration: `impl<SM> Actor for SM where SM: StateMachine + Send`
  * Direct event forwarding: `self.send(&event)` in `on_event()`
  * Compile-time type safety: `Address<TrafficLightEvent>` only accepts valid events

#### Mailbox & Back-pressure System (COMPLETE)
* **Platform-Specific Back-pressure**: Implemented unified `SendError<T>` with platform-appropriate semantics

  * Type aliases: `Inbox<T, N>` and `Outbox<T, N>` with conditional compilation
  * Const generic `N` parameter for configurable capacity

#### Event Loop & Spawning (COMPLETE)
* **Spawning Functions**: Implemented Embassy and Tokio spawning functions
  * `spawn_actor_embassy()` with `'static` lifetime handling
  * `spawn_actor_tokio()` with proper Send bounds and runtime integration
  * Graceful termination via mailbox closure and lifecycle hooks

#### Testing & Validation (COMPLETE)

  * StateMachine integration patterns
  * Error handling and edge cases
* **Platform-Specific Testing**: Validated embedded fail-fast vs std async back-pressure behavior
