# Progress Log - 2025-05-31

## Session Summary
* **Author**: @claude-4-sonnet MAX (via @0xjcf)
* **Phase**: 05-async-integration
* **Branch**: feat/phase-05-async-integration

## Work Completed

### Code Review Fixes (3 Issues Addressed)

#### 3. Borrow Checker Conflict Fix
* **File**: `lit-bit-core/src/actor/supervision.rs`
* **Issue**: Overlapping borrows in `execute_restarts` method - immutable borrow of `self.children` when retrieving `child_info`, then attempted mutable borrow with `get_mut`
* **Root Cause**: The restart factory call held an immutable reference while the code later tried to take a mutable reference to update child state
* **Fix**: Restructured logic to temporarily remove child from supervision map, call restart factory, then re-insert with updated state
* **Impact**: Resolves borrow checker errors while maintaining proper supervision functionality and restart semantics

#### 13. Conditional Compilation Bug Fix
* **File**: `lit-bit-core/src/actor/supervision.rs`
* **Issue**: `add_child_with_handle_and_factory` method had conditional compilation bug where `is_running` field was set in Tokio-specific code
* **Root Cause**: Method was already conditionally compiled for "async-tokio" feature but contained `#[cfg(not(feature = "async-tokio"))]` block setting `is_running` field which doesn't exist in Tokio environments
* **Fix**: Removed the `#[cfg(not(feature = "async-tokio"))]` attribute and `is_running: true` field initialization from the method
* **Impact**: Resolves compilation errors and ensures proper conditional compilation across all feature combinations

### CI/CD Pipeline Fixes
* Fixed recurring "Check & Lint (nightly)" CI job failures due to clippy::uninlined_format_args warnings
* Updated format strings in `lit-bit-core/src/timer.rs` test assertion message to use inline format arguments
* Fixed test assertion on lines 250-253: `"TestTimer should complete immediately, not after the requested duration. Elapsed: {elapsed:?}"` to use inline format syntax

### Timer Testing Infrastructure Improvements
* **Enhanced TestTimer Implementation**: Redesigned TestTimer to be more robust and useful for testing
  - Replaced simple struct with dedicated TestTimer and TestSleepFuture types
  - Added duration preservation capability for test assertions
  - Implemented proper Future trait with immediate completion but preserved timing information
  
* **Added Comprehensive Timer Tests**:
  - `test_timer_preserves_requested_duration()`: Verifies duration preservation in test futures
  - `test_timer_with_different_durations()`: Tests various duration formats (secs, millis, micros, nanos, zero)
  - `test_timer_future_completes_immediately()`: Ensures deterministic test behavior with immediate completion
  
* **Improved Duration Conversion Testing**:
  - Enhanced test coverage with proper assertion message formatting for nightly clippy compliance
  - Added proper overflow behavior testing with safe edge cases
  - Enhanced test coverage for duration_to_u64_micros helper function

### Code Quality Enhancements
* **Better Test Determinism**: TestTimer now provides predictable behavior for statechart timer testing
* **Preserved Timing Semantics**: Tests can verify correct timer usage without introducing actual delays
* **Enhanced Documentation**: Improved inline documentation for timer testing patterns
* **Conditional Compilation Robustness**: All feature-gated code properly validated for correct compilation

## Git Commits
* **Hash**: `pending` - "fix(ci): resolve nightly clippy warnings, enhance timer testing infrastructure, and fix conditional compilation bug"

## Testing Status
* ✅ `cargo +nightly clippy --all-targets --workspace -- -D warnings` passes
* ✅ `cargo +nightly check --all-targets --workspace` passes  
* ✅ `cargo clippy --all-targets --workspace -- -D warnings` (stable) passes
* ✅ New timer tests pass with proper duration preservation
* ✅ Enhanced test coverage for timer module edge cases
* ✅ All feature combinations compile correctly (async-tokio, async-embassy, no-default-features)
* ✅ Supervision tests pass with tokio features enabled
* All linter issues resolved for nightly builds

## Next Steps
* Complete commit with proper progress log documentation
* Monitor CI pipeline to ensure sustained nightly job success
* Continue Phase 5 async integration with improved timer testing infrastructure
* Consider applying similar testing improvements to other async components

## Technical Notes
* **TestTimer Design**: Now returns TestSleepFuture instead of Ready<()> for better test introspection
* **Duration Preservation**: Tests can verify exact timing requests without waiting for actual delays
* **Assertion Formatting**: Updated test assertions to use inline format arguments for nightly clippy compliance
* **Future Compliance**: Proper Future implementation with immediate polling completion
* **Conditional Compilation**: Fixed feature-gated code to ensure proper compilation across all feature combinations
