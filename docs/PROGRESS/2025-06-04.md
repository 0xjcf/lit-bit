## Session Summary
* **Author**: @claude-4-sonnet MAX (via @0xjcf)
* **Phase**: 05-async-side-effects (Sprint 4)
* **Branch**: feat/phase-05-async-integration
* **Status**: Benchmark Infrastructure Overhaul, Macro Hygiene Fixes, Embassy Updates & Example Improvements

## Work Completed

### üöÄ Benchmark Infrastructure Overhaul
* **Runtime System Enhancements**: Major improvements to the benchmark runtime system
  - Fixed `FuturesLiteExecutor` to use proper concurrent spawning with `async-executor` instead of blocking
  - Enhanced `TokioExecutor` with accurate worker thread reporting (returns configured count, not CPU cores)
  - Added `EmbassyExecutor` with proper spawning support and descriptive error handling
  - Implemented comprehensive `RuntimeError` enum with detailed error messages
  - Fixed blocking operations and added platform-specific behavior documentation

* **Concurrent Spawning Fixes**: Replaced blocking executor implementations with proper async spawning
  - `FuturesLiteExecutor::spawn()` now properly spawns futures concurrently using background thread
  - `EmbassyExecutor::spawn()` uses `async_executor::Executor` for proper concurrent execution
  - Added comprehensive tests verifying concurrent behavior with shared state and timeouts
  - Improved error handling for embassy blocking operations (not supported in embedded environments)

### üìä Benchmark Suite Enhancements
* **Message Throughput Benchmarks**: Enhanced with realistic async workloads and concurrent testing
  - Added `AsyncTestActor` with real async work (tokio sleep, yield operations)
  - Created separate benchmarks for concurrent vs sequential message sending patterns
  - Added non-blocking `try_send` benchmarks for comparison with async `send`
  - Improved benchmark structure with proper cleanup and shared runtime usage

* **Performance Metrics Improvements**: Fixed calculation errors and improved accuracy
  - Fixed percentile calculation in metrics module (50th percentile: 250‚Üí200 nanoseconds)
  - Enhanced runtime type ordering in benchmarks for consistent reporting
  - Added proper async workload simulation with configurable delays

### üîß Core Library Improvements

## Code Review Fixes Session

### üõ†Ô∏è Async Throughput Benchmark Fixes
* **Fixed Self Borrowing Issue in AsyncTestActor**: Resolved critical compilation issue in `async_throughput.rs`
  - **Problem**: `AsyncTestActor::handle()` method tried to access `self.count` inside an `async move` block where `self` was not captured
  - **Solution**: Moved state mutation (`self.count += msg.0`) outside the async block to happen immediately when `&mut self` is available
  - **Impact**: Benchmark now compiles correctly while preserving async workload simulation for realistic performance testing
  - **Code Quality**: Follows Rust borrowing rules and maintains actor semantics properly

### üßπ Memory Usage Benchmark Cleanup
* **Removed Unused Thread-Local Allocator**: Cleaned up dead code in `memory_usage.rs`
  - **Removed**: Unused `thread_local! { ALLOCATOR }` and corresponding `RefCell` import
  - **Reason**: All allocation tracking uses `GLOBAL_ALLOCATOR` instead, making the thread-local version redundant
  - **Impact**: Reduces code complexity and eliminates unused imports

* **Split Feature-Conditional Tests**: Improved benchmark organization and clarity
  - **Before**: Single `static_mailbox_operation` test with confusing internal `#[cfg]` blocks
  - **After**: Separate tests with clear platform-specific expectations:
    - `no_std_mailbox_zero_allocation`: Only compiles without `async-tokio`, asserts zero allocations
    - `async_tokio_mailbox_operation`: Only compiles with `async-tokio`, accepts allocations
  - **Benefits**: Clearer intent, better error messages, eliminates reader confusion

### ‚ö° Transition Latency Benchmark Simplification
* **Removed Unnecessary Async Infrastructure**: Streamlined `transition_latency.rs` for pure sync operation
  - **Removed**: Unused `TokioBuilder`, `rt.block_on()` wrapper around sync `machine.send()` calls
  - **Simplified**: `BenchContext` is now an empty struct (removed unused `counter` field and redundant `new()` method)
  - **Updated**: Both benchmarks now test the same sync operation, renamed for clarity:
    - `sync_transition`: Baseline sync state machine performance
    - `transition_baseline`: Alternative measurement setup
  - **Impact**: Eliminates unnecessary async overhead from synchronous operation benchmarks

### üîí Platform-Specific Import Safety
* **Fixed Unix-Specific Imports in lib.rs**: Added conditional compilation for platform compatibility
  - **Added**: `#[cfg(unix)]` attributes to `std::os::unix::process::ExitStatusExt` and related imports
  - **Reason**: These imports are only available on Unix-like systems and would cause compilation failures on Windows
  - **Aligns**: With the platform-specific `collect_perf_stats` function that calls Unix `perf stat` command

### üì¶ Embassy Dependency Alignment
* **Updated Embassy Versions**: Resolved version misalignment in `lit-bit-core/Cargo.toml`
  - **Embassy-sync**: Updated from 0.6.0 ‚Üí 0.7.0 to align with `embassy-executor` 0.7
  - **Embassy-futures**: Updated from 0.1 ‚Üí 0.1.1 (patch version for bug fixes)
  - **Embassy-time**: Updated from 0.4 ‚Üí 0.4.0 with explicit `tick-hz-32_768` feature
  - **Impact**: Ensures compatible Embassy ecosystem versions, prevents dependency conflicts

### üìã Testing & Validation
* ‚úÖ **Async throughput benchmark**: Now compiles and runs correctly with proper state mutation
* ‚úÖ **Memory usage benchmarks**: Clean separation between no_std and async-tokio feature sets
* ‚úÖ **Transition latency**: Simplified and focused on pure sync performance measurement
* ‚úÖ **Platform compatibility**: Unix-specific imports properly gated for cross-platform builds
* ‚úÖ **Embassy integration**: All dependency versions aligned and compatible

### üéØ Quality Improvements
* **Better Error Messages**: Feature-conditional tests provide clearer failure explanations
* **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminated confusing mixed conditional logic within single functions
* **Memory Safety**: Fixed borrowing violations that would prevent compilation
* **Cross-Platform**: Improved compatibility across different operating systems
* **Dependency Health**: Resolved version conflicts and updated to latest stable releases

  ```yaml
  env:
    RAYON_NUM_THREADS: 1  # Fix for cargo-geiger panic
  steps:
    - name: Pre-fetch dependencies for target  # Avoid download races
    - name: Enhanced debugging and error detection
  ```

### üß™ Testing & Validation
* **Local Reproduction**: Successfully reproduced and fixed the panic locally
  - **Before**: Consistent panic with `assertion failed: self.pending_ids.insert(id)`
  - **After**: Clean execution with 57KB JSON report generation
  - **Verification**: `‚úÖ lit-bit-core contains no unsafe code (used: 0)`

* **End-to-End CI Simulation**: Validated complete pipeline flow
  - **Dependency Pre-fetching**: Eliminates potential download conflicts
  - **JSON Report Generation**: 57,328 bytes of comprehensive dependency analysis
  - **Integration Testing**: `heap-safety-check` tool correctly processes generated report
  - **Safety Confirmation**: Maintains üîí symbol for `lit-bit-core` (forbids unsafe code)

### üéØ Strategic Benefits
