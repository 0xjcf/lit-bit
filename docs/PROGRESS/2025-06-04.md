# Progress Log - 2025-06-04

## Session Summary
* **Author**: @claude-4-sonnet MAX (via @0xjcf)
* **Phase**: 05-async-side-effects (Sprint 4)
* **Branch**: feat/phase-05-async-integration
* **Status**: Benchmark Infrastructure Overhaul, Macro Hygiene Fixes, Embassy Updates & Example Improvements

## Work Completed

### üöÄ Benchmark Infrastructure Overhaul
* **Runtime System Enhancements**: Major improvements to the benchmark runtime system
  - Fixed `FuturesLiteExecutor` to use proper concurrent spawning with `async-executor` instead of blocking
  - Enhanced `TokioExecutor` with accurate worker thread reporting (returns configured count, not CPU cores)
  - Added `EmbassyExecutor` with proper spawning support and descriptive error handling
  - Implemented comprehensive `RuntimeError` enum with detailed error messages
  - Fixed blocking operations and added platform-specific behavior documentation

* **Concurrent Spawning Fixes**: Replaced blocking executor implementations with proper async spawning
  - `FuturesLiteExecutor::spawn()` now properly spawns futures concurrently using background thread
  - `EmbassyExecutor::spawn()` uses `async_executor::Executor` for proper concurrent execution
  - Added comprehensive tests verifying concurrent behavior with shared state and timeouts
  - Improved error handling for embassy blocking operations (not supported in embedded environments)

### üìä Benchmark Suite Enhancements
* **Message Throughput Benchmarks**: Enhanced with realistic async workloads and concurrent testing
  - Added `AsyncTestActor` with real async work (tokio sleep, yield operations)
  - Created separate benchmarks for concurrent vs sequential message sending patterns
  - Added non-blocking `try_send` benchmarks for comparison with async `send`
  - Improved benchmark structure with proper cleanup and shared runtime usage

* **Performance Metrics Improvements**: Fixed calculation errors and improved accuracy
  - Fixed percentile calculation in metrics module (50th percentile: 250‚Üí200 nanoseconds)
  - Enhanced runtime type ordering in benchmarks for consistent reporting
  - Added proper async workload simulation with configurable delays

### üîß Core Library Improvements
* **Macro Hygiene Fixes**: Fixed `static_mailbox!` macro to prevent import conflicts
  - Changed `StaticCell` to `::static_cell::StaticCell` (fully qualified path)
  - Changed `heapless::spsc::Queue` to `::heapless::spsc::Queue` (fully qualified path)
  - Fixed `define_static_mailbox` macro with same hygiene improvements
  - This prevents namespace pollution and resolves import conflicts in user code

* **Debug Trait Implementation**: Fixed Debug derivation issues for types containing `dyn Future`
  - Removed automatic `#[derive(Debug)]` from `TimerHandle` enum due to `dyn Future` fields
  - Added custom `Debug` implementation with descriptive placeholder text:
    - `Tokio("<JoinHandle>")` for Tokio timer handles
    - `Embassy("<Future>")` for Embassy timer handles
  - Maintains debugging capabilities while avoiding trait bound issues

### üè≠ Embassy Ecosystem Updates
* **Embassy Dependency Updates**: Updated to latest stable versions
  - `embassy-time`: 0.3 ‚Üí 0.4 (latest stable with improved timer APIs)
  - `embassy-executor`: 0.6 ‚Üí 0.7 (latest stable with enhanced task management)
  - Removed deprecated `integrated-timers` feature from executor configuration
  - Updated both ARM Cortex-M and host build configurations consistently

* **Embassy Runtime Integration**: Improved embassy executor integration in benchmarks
  - Added `create_embassy_executor_with_spawner()` for proper embassy context creation
  - Enhanced error messages explaining embassy spawner requirements
  - Added comprehensive tests for embassy runtime error scenarios

### üìö Example Improvements
* **Coffee Shop Example Cleanup**: Simplified and made more reliable
  - Removed conflicting `#![no_std]` and `#![no_main]` compilation directives
  - Updated Cargo.toml to require `async-tokio` instead of `panic-halt`
  - Fixed mailbox API usage: changed from heapless methods (`enqueue`/`dequeue`) to Tokio methods (`send`/`try_recv`)
  - Removed conditional compilation complexity and unused enum variants
  - Updated documentation to reflect std-only operation

* **Actor Integration Example**: Fixed feature dependencies and imports
  - Added proper feature gating for std-specific imports
  - Improved conditional compilation for cross-platform compatibility
  - Enhanced documentation and usage examples

## Git Commits
* **Hash**: `c874b01` - "feat(actor): improve mailbox patterns and SPSC queue handling"

## Testing Status
* ‚úÖ All core unit tests passing
* ‚úÖ All integration tests passing  
* ‚úÖ All macro tests passing
* ‚úÖ Benchmark suite running with enhanced concurrent testing
* ‚úÖ Embassy dependency updates compatible
* ‚úÖ Coffee shop example working reliably with `cargo run --example coffee_shop --features async-tokio`
* ‚úÖ No regressions in existing functionality

## Performance Improvements
* **Concurrent Executor Performance**: Fixed blocking executor implementations
  - FuturesLite executor now supports true concurrent task spawning
  - Embassy executor properly integrates with async-executor for better performance
  - Benchmark accuracy improved with realistic async workloads
  - Memory usage optimized with proper background thread management

* **Macro Hygiene Performance**: Reduced compilation overhead
  - Fully qualified paths prevent namespace pollution
  - Reduced import resolution overhead in user code
  - Improved compile-time error messages for macro users

## Technical Debt Reduction
* **Executor Architecture**: Cleaned up runtime abstraction layer
  - Unified error handling across all executor types
  - Consistent spawning behavior between Tokio and FuturesLite
  - Better separation of platform-specific concerns
  - Comprehensive test coverage for edge cases

* **Dependency Management**: Updated to latest stable versions
  - Embassy 0.7 series provides better stability and performance
  - Removed deprecated features to reduce technical debt
  - Improved compatibility matrix across different target platforms

## Next Steps
* Consider adding more comprehensive benchmark scenarios (memory pressure, high-frequency messages)
* Evaluate adding Embassy-specific benchmarks for embedded performance characteristics  
* Review other macro implementations for similar hygiene improvements
* Consider extracting executor abstractions into a separate benchmarking utility crate
* Add property-based testing for concurrent executor behavior
* Investigate performance characteristics of different embassy timer implementations
