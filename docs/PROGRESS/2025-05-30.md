# Progress Log - 2025-05-30

## Session Summary
* **Author**: @assistant (AI-agent)
* **Phase**: 05-async-side-effects
* **Branch**: main
* **Status**: Linter Compliance & Async Error Handling Improvements

## Work Completed

### Linter Error Resolution
* **Fixed clippy::cmp_owned warning** in `lit-bit-macro/src/lib.rs:5161`
  - Changed `state.local_name.to_string() == "AsyncState"` to `state.local_name == "AsyncState"`
  - Eliminated unnecessary string allocation during comparison
  - Follows `always-respect-linter` rule from cursor rules

### Async Handler Validation
* **Enhanced user experience** with helpful error messages for async handlers
  - Added early validation in `generate_states_array` function
  - Rejects async handlers with clear, actionable error message:
    > "Async entry handlers are not yet supported in the current version. Full async support requires integration with the Actor trait system. Please use sync entry handlers for now, or wait for the async actor integration in a future release."
  - Provides specific error location using state name span
  - Explains current limitations and suggests alternatives

### Test Infrastructure
* **Fixed failing test** `test_async_detection_and_helpful_errors`
  - Test was expecting async handlers to be rejected with helpful error
  - Previously the code was allowing async handlers through without proper validation
  - Now properly validates and rejects with expected error message

### Code Quality Improvements
* **Maintained zero-cost abstractions** for sync-only statecharts
* **Preserved existing conditional async generation logic** while adding validation
* **Enhanced error message clarity** following research-driven UX principles

## Git Commits
* **Hash**: `[pending]` - "fix: resolve linter error and add async handler validation"

## Testing Status
* ✅ **All macro tests passing**: 72/72 tests pass
* ✅ **All core tests passing**: 21/21 tests pass  
* ✅ **All integration tests passing**: 27/27 tests pass
* ✅ **All linter checks passing**: No warnings or errors
* ✅ **Full CI compliance**: All feature combinations and targets building

## Key Metrics Maintained
* **Zero regressions**: All existing functionality preserved
* **Error message quality**: Clear, actionable guidance for users
* **Linter compliance**: 100% clippy compliance with `-D warnings`
* **Test coverage**: Comprehensive test suite with async detection validation

## Next Steps
* **Commit the changes** with conventional commit message
* **Continue Phase 05 development** with enhanced error handling foundation
* **Consider timer transition validation** for consistency with async handler validation
* **Review other potential UX improvements** for procedural macro error messages

## Technical Notes
* **Async detection preserved**: `TmpStateTreeBuilder::contains_async_handlers()` still functional
* **Conditional code generation maintained**: Ready for future full async support
* **Error location precision**: Uses state name span for accurate IDE highlighting
* **Zero-cost principle**: Sync-only paths remain optimized
