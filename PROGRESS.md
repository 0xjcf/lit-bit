## New Location

**Progress tracking has moved to**: [`docs/PROGRESS/`](./docs/PROGRESS/)

2. **Better Organization**: Individual files per date for easier navigation
3. **Improved Structure**: Consistent format with git commit references
4. **Enhanced Navigation**: Index file with links and current status
