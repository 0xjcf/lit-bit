Reverse-chronological log of daily coding sessions.  Keep entries **concise** and link to PRs / issues for full detail.

_Add new sessions below this line._ 

## 2025-05-22 · _Session End_
* _Author_: @AI-agent Default (via @0xjcf)
* _Phase_: 1-core-runtime / macro
* _Work_: Debugged and fixed failing macro test (`parse_and_build_hierarchical_showcase_example`) by correcting the test assertion for the self-transition in the `Active` state. All macro and core tests now pass. Cleaned up debug output and ensured linter compliance throughout. See commit for details.
* _Next_: Review for any further macro edge cases, then proceed to next roadmap phase or feature.

## 2025-05-22 · _Session Start_
* _Author_: @AI-agent Default (via @0xjcf)
* _Phase_: 1-core-runtime
* _Work_: Fixed hierarchical state entry/exit bugs: (1) cross-root transition fallback/entry path, (2) double entry on child-to-parent, (3) dedup for parallel region leaf self-transition. All changes respect linter and explicit naming rules. See commit for details.
* _Next_: Re-run full test suite and verify all hierarchical/parallel transition tests pass. 

## 2024-05-21 · _Session End_
*   _Author_: @Gemini (via @0xjcf)
*   _Phase_: 03-parallel-states (Macro Refactor & Test Corrections)
*   _Work_:
    *   Refactored the `statechart!` macro's code generation for the `send` method. It now delegates directly to `Runtime::send_internal` in `lit-bit-core`. This resolved a persistent E0317 linter error ("if may be missing else clause") and fixed numerous test failures related to incorrect transition processing in hierarchical and parallel states.
    *   Removed the `generate_send_method` and `analyse_event_pattern` functions from `lit-bit-macro` as they are no longer needed.
    *   Addressed various Clippy lints (`dead_code`, `trivially_copy_pass_by_ref`, `uninlined_format_args`, `unreachable_code`) across `lit-bit-macro` and `lit-bit-core`.
    *   Corrected test logic in `core::tests::send_event_no_transition_if_guard_fails` and standardized log messages in `basic_machine_integration_test::parallel_initial_state_test`.
    *   Temporarily commented out the `LoadTrack` event and associated logic in the `media_player.rs` example to resolve compile errors from its incomplete implementation, enabling other tests to pass.
*   _Next_:
    *   Re-evaluate the implementation of events with data (like `LoadTrack`) and guards, ensuring the new `Runtime::send_internal` delegation handles them correctly.
    *   Address any remaining failing tests or new issues arising from this significant refactor.
    *   Continue with Phase 03 tasks, focusing on robust parallel state functionality and the media player example.


## 2024-05-19 · _Session Start_
*   _Author_: @Gemini (via @0xjcf)
*   _Phase_: 03-parallel-states (Enhancement: Macro Event Pattern Matching)
*   _Work_:
    *   Pivoting to implement pattern matching for events with associated data directly within the `statechart!` macro (e.g., `on Event::Variant { field } => ...`).
    *   Modified `TransitionDefinitionAst` and `Parse` impl to use `event_pattern: syn::Pat` (via `Pat::parse_single`).
    *   Updated `TmpTransition` to hold `event_pattern: &'ast syn::Pat`.
    *   Updated `code_generator::generate_machine_struct_and_impl` to generate a `send()` method with `match event { ... }` structure using these patterns. Placeholder for full transition logic.
    *   Temporarily used `compile_error!` for `Transition.event` field in `generate_transitions_array` to handle type mismatch during refactor.
*   _Next_:
    *   Fix linter errors in `lit-bit-macro` tests related to `event_name` vs `event_pattern`.
    *   Update `GuardFn` type in `lit-bit-core` to take `&EventType`.
    *   Update macro code generation for guards to pass `&event`.
    *   Implement and test the actual transition logic (LCA, entry/exit actions) within the generated `send()` method.
    *   Verify full functionality with `media_player.rs` example, including events with data and guards.

## 2024-05-19 · _Session End_
*   _Author_: @Gemini (via @0xjcf)
*   _Phase_: 03-parallel-states (Runtime Bugfixing & Test Completion)
*   _Work_:
    *   Successfully debugged and fixed all remaining failing unit and integration tests for hierarchical and parallel state transitions.
    *   Key fixes involved multiple iterations on:
        *   `find_lca` to correctly determine the lowest common ancestor.
        *   `execute_entry_actions_from_lca` and `enter_state_recursive_logic` to ensure correct entry action sequencing, avoid duplicates, and properly handle region/child initialization (using `run_entry_action_for_this_state` flag and explicit entry for region containers).
        *   De-duplication logic in `Runtime::send()` for `arbitrated_transitions` to prevent multiple executions of the same transition definition.
    *   Refined test assertions for parallel state logs to be robust against valid interleaving of actions from orthogonal regions.
    *   Addressed numerous Clippy lints in both `lit-bit-core/src/core/mod.rs` (tests module) and `lit-bit-core/tests/parallel_machine_integration_test.rs`.
    *   Added several new integration tests for parallel state scenarios in `parallel_machine_integration_test.rs`.
    *   All 28 `lit-bit-core` tests and 52 `lit-bit-macro` tests are now passing.
*   _Next_:
    *   Complete the final integration test for parallel states (event targeting a single region).
    *   Proceed with Task 4.3 (media player example) and Task 5 (documentation).

        *   Updated macro to pass `&MACHINE_DEF_CONST` to `Runtime::new`.
        *   Refactored loop for finding colliding variant names in `generate_state_id_logic`.
        *   Changed `max_nodes_for_computation_val` to use `quote!{ M_VAL * lit_bit_core::core::MAX_ACTIVE_REGIONS }` and ensured it's used as `{ expr }` in generic arguments.
    *   Tests (`lit-bit-core/tests/basic_machine_integration_test.rs`):
        *   Updated tests to use `static MachineDefinition`s for `&'static` lifetime compliance.

    *   The typo in the previous PROGRESS.md entry was fixed implicitly by creating this new entry structure.
    *   Addressed an unclosed delimiter error in `core/mod.rs` test section caused by previous model edits.
*   _Next_:
    *   Submit current changes for a new code review.

        *   `retain` predicate logic in `send()` for parallel composite self-transitions.
        *   Optimization of child lookup for parallel states (macro & core).
        *   Optimization of the arbitration loop in `send()`.
    *   Consider other deferred items like further error propagation (e.g. from `execute_entry_actions_from_lca`).

## 2025-05-17 · _Session End (Linter & Runtime Refinements)_
*   _Author_: @Gemini (via @0xjcf)
*   _Phase_: 03-parallel-states (Runtime Refinement)
*   _Work_:
    *   Fixed a runtime bug where simple leaf self-transitions would result in an empty active state set by ensuring the state is correctly processed through the entry execution path in `Runtime::send()`.
    *   Addressed a comprehensive set of Clippy linter warnings and compilation errors across `lit-bit-core`, `lit-bit-macro`, and example files. This included fixes for `unreachable_code`, `manual_assert`, `uninlined_format_args`, const generic argument inference in examples, and `const fn` compatibility.
    *   Corrected state definitions in the `traffic_light.rs` (RISC-V) example to resolve a runtime hang.
    *   Refactored test assertions in `basic_machine_integration_test.rs` for clarity and correctness.
*   _Next_:
    *   (This was the start of the session that just ended, the work above effectively replaces these next steps as they were completed or superseded by the new review).

    *   Refactored state entry helpers (`enter_state_recursive_logic`, `execute_entry_actions_from_lca`) in `lit-bit-core` to support parallel semantics and return `heapless::Vec` of active states. (Task 3.3 DONE from `prompts/decomposition/03_parallel_states_tasks.md`).
    *   Implemented new hierarchical and parallel-aware exit logic:
        *   Added `clear_and_exit_state` helper for post-order exit of a state and its active children/regions.
        *   Updated `Runtime::send()` to use this helper in an upward traversal from the exited leaf to LCA, replacing the old exit logic. (Task 3.4 DONE from `prompts/decomposition/03_parallel_states_tasks.md`).
    *   Corrected self-transition logic in `Runtime::send()` to ensure proper exit/entry actions.
    *   Resolved all linter errors and fixed all failing tests in `lit-bit-core` and `lit-bit-macro`. All tests now passing.
