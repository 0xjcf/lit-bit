/// Platform-neutral timer service trait for async sleep operations.

/// This trait provides zero-cost abstractions for timer operations across
/// different async runtimes (Tokio, Embassy) while maintaining `no_std` compatibility.
///
/// # Design Philosophy
///
/// - **Zero-cost**: No heap allocation, futures live on the stack
/// - **Platform-agnostic**: Same API works with Tokio, Embassy, or custom runtimes
/// - **Feature-gated**: Only compiled when async features are enabled
///
/// # Usage
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// // In generated statechart code:
/// TimerService::sleep(Duration::from_secs(5)).await;
/// ```
pub trait TimerService {
    /// The future type returned by the sleep operation.
